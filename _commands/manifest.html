<h3>Why use a content type ID manifest?</h3>

<p>As of this writing, SharePoint honors <strong>field IDs</strong> when created using the REST API. <strong>It will not, however, honor content type IDs</strong> when created using the REST API. Any content type ID that you provide when creating a new content type will be ignored by SharePoint. For this reason, Engineer uses a <strong>manifest</strong> list to store content type IDs for future reference. Always use the convenience method (<code>contentTypes.getByName('My Content Type')</code>) when referencing a custom content type created by Engineer, and avoid referencing any custom content types by their ID (which could change from environment to environment).</p>
