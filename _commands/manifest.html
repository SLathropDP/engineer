<h3>Why use a manifest?</h3>

<p>Content type IDs can be a bit unruly because of their length and structure. To make these easier to work with, Engineer uses a content type ID <strong>manifest</strong> list, which is used to store content type IDs for any custom content types created by migrations. These content types can later be referenced by name, allowing Engineer to automatically fetch the correct content type ID even if it differs from environment to environment.</p>
