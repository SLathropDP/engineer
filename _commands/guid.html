<h3>About Content Type IDs</h3>

<p>The <code>guid</code> command is useful for creating persistent content type IDs that remain the same even when migrating to other environments. You aren&rsquo;t required, however, to explicitly set an ID if you so choose. Engineer uses a content type ID <strong>manifest</strong> list, which is used to store content type IDs for any custom content types created by migrations. These content types can later be referenced by name, allowing Engineer to automatically fetch the correct content type ID even if it differs from environment to environment.</p>
