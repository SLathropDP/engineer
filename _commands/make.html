<h1><code>engineer make &lt;name&gt;</code></h1>

<p class="lead">Create a new migration file.</p>

<hr>

<h4>Options</h4>
<dl>
  <dt><code>name</code></dt>
  <dd>A descriptive name for the new migration <span class="muted">(required)</span></dd>
</dl>

<hr>

<p>The <code>make</code> command is used to create a new migration file template. This template will be placed into a <code>migrations</code> directory under the current working directory (a new directory will be created if it does not exist). Each migration file is timestamped with the current UTC time. This ensures that migrations can always be run in order, or rolled back in reverse order.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

{% highlight sh %}
# Create migration file
engineer make create-new-list

# Create migration file from string
engineer make "Add Fields to List"
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Organization and Naming</h3>

<p>The organization and naming of your migrations is entirely up to you. We recommend that you organize migrations into concise files that focus on a single operation. Avoid huge migration files that perform many actions. This will allow more granular control over migration operations in the future.</p>

<p>As an example, a solution that deploys a content type may have several migrations, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>create-fields</code></li>
  <li><code>create-content-type</code></li>
  <li><code>add-fields-to-content-type</code></li>
</ul>

<p>By organizing your migrations in such a way, you and other developers on your team will be able to easily roll back and migrate specific features of your configuration solution at any given time.</p>

<h3>Important Note on Persistent Naming</h3>

<p>Engineer uses each migration&rsquo;s file name to track migration status in SharePoint environments. Do not change migration file names once they have been migrated to any environment, else Engineer will see the file as an entirely new migration.</p>
