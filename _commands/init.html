<h1><code>engineer init</code></h1>
<p class="lead">Initialize the current working directory as an Engineer project folder.</p>

<hr>

<p>The <code>init</code> command creates <code>.gitignore</code> and <code>env.js</code> files if they do not already exist in the current working directory.</p>

<h3 class="h5">Important Security Consideration</h3>
<p>If you are using source control to track migration changes, we highly recommend ignoring the <code>env.js</code> from any code repositories in order to prevent sensitive authentication information from being shared. If you are using <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> source control, the <code>.gitignore</code> file will take care of this for you.</p>
