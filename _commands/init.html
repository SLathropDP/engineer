<h1><code>engineer init</code></h1>

<p class="lead">Initialize the current working directory as an Engineer project folder.</p>

<hr>

<p>The <code>init</code> command creates <code>.gitignore</code> and <code>env.js</code> files if they do not already exist in the current working directory.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

{% highlight sh %}
engineer init
{% endhighlight %}

<hr>

<h3>Important Security Consideration</h3>

<p>If you are using source control to track migration changes, we highly recommend ignoring the <code>env.js</code> from any code repositories in order to prevent sensitive authentication information from being shared.</p>
