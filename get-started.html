<h1>Get Started with Engineer</h1>

<hr>

<h2 id="what-is-engineer">What is Engineer?</h2>

<p>Engineer is a powerful command-line tool to help track and consolidate SharePoint configuration changes in any number of environments. It&rsquo;s like version control for site columns, content types, lists, views, and more.</p>

<p>Engineer is inspired by <a href="https://laravel.com">Laravel</a> migrations, and is made possible by <a href="https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP-JS-Core">PnP-JS-Core</a>, <a href="https://github.com/s-KaiNet/node-pnp-js">node-pnp-js</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/vgrem/CSOMNode">CSOMNode</a>.</p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

{% highlight sh %}
npm i -g sp-engineer
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Once installed, you can type <code>engineer</code> into any console prompt to run Engineer commands. Use <code>engineer -h</code> to see a list of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link commands.html %}">commands</a>.</p>

<h3>Start a New Project</h3>

{% highlight sh %}
engineer init
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The <code><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _commands/init.html %}">init</a></code> command creates <code>env.js</code> in the current working directory. This file contains important configuration information such as the SharePoint site URL and authentication settings. Any authentication configuration supported by <a href="https://github.com/s-KaiNet/node-sp-auth">node-sp-auth</a> can be used as the <code>auth</code> settings in your <code>env.js</code> file.</p>

<h3>Install Engineer Lists</h3>

<p>Once your <code>env.js</code> file is set up, you&rsquo;re ready to install Engineer lists to your target SharePoint environment.</p>

{% highlight sh %}
engineer install
{% endhighlight %}

<h2 id="migrations">Migrations</h2>

<p>Engineer uses <strong>migrations</strong> to track configuration changes made to SharePoint. You can use migrations to create a queue of tasks that are executed in order on any number of target environments. Think of migrations like source control for your configuration operations.</p>

<h3>New Migration</h3>

{% highlight sh %}
engineer make my-first-migration
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The <code><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _commands/make.html %}">make</a></code> command creates a file called <code>migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-my-first-migration.js</code> (<code>YYYYMMDDHHMMSS</code> is replaced by the current UTC timestamp). Feel free to open this file to see what&rsquo;s inside. By default, new migrations are configured to create a new list called <code>My List</code> when migrated.</p>

<h3>Migrate</h3>

{% highlight sh %}
engineer migrate
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The <code><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _commands/migrate.html %}">migrate</a></code> command activates pending migrations. A new list called <code>My List</code> will be created on the target SharePoint site when this migration is activated.</p>

<h3>Roll Back</h3>

{% highlight sh %}
engineer rollback
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The <code><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _commands/rollback.html %}">rollback</a></code> command retracts active migrations. Once rolled back, <code>My List</code> is deleted from the target SharePoint site.</p>

<h2 id="multiple-environments">Multiple Environments</h2>

<p>You can create copies of <code>env.js</code>, allowing you to store authentication and configuration for multiple SharePoint environments. Use Engineer&rsquo;s <code><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link commands.html %}#config">--config</a></code> option to switch environments when running any command.</p>

{% highlight sh %}
engineer -c env/dev.js migrate
engineer -c env/prod.js migrate
{% endhighlight %}
